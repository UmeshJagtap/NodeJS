What is GraphQL
> GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows client to request exactly the data they need --nothing ore, nothing less.
> Created by Facebook in 2012 (open sourced in 2015), GrphQL solves ineffiencies commonly

mutation - crud operation
subscription -real time updates

apollo server
express-graphql
graphql packages


client /frontend sends query
graphql validate
calls resolver function
fetch the data from database
return json response

POST /graphql


Benefits of GraphQL
> Ask for what you need 
> One endpoint for everything
> Strong typing -> safer API's, strongly-typed schemas: Self-documenting API, IDE autocompletion and validation.
> Perfect for UI-driven development - Great for UI composition and mobile bandwidth constraints.
> Fewer backend requests
> Easy API evolution (no versions)
> Excellent tooling ecosystem - GraphQL/Apollo Sandbox, codgen for TS/JS, schema registries.  

Limitations of GraphQL
> Harder caching than REST, Because every request is dynamic 
> Can cause N+1 performance problems -Solve via DataLoader (batch DB calls)
> More complex server logic 
> Not always necessary - For simple CRUD microservices, REST may be easier.
> Learning curve for teams used to REST
